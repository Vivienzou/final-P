RSA cryptography
So far I am working on reading the material about introduction of RSA, future direction and application as well as RSA problem. 
brief outline of my eassy:

INTRODUCTION
-------------
people and real world application)

ref:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm)

KEY ELEMENT/BACKGROUND
--------------
(definitions, RSA numbers)

ref:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_numbers

ALGORITHM
-------------
which will be the main part I am working for the next week. I am still looking for alternative algorithm which is different or more advanced
than those given in class. 

encryption

decryption

Chinese remainder 

EXAMPLES
-------------

FUTURE DIRECTION AND CHALLENGES 
---------------------
attacks aganist RSA

RSA factoring challenge
RSA problems
